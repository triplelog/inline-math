The Basics

Display $(-b \pm sqrt(4*x+7))/(7)$

aligned

$align(1=2,3=4)[=]$

$align(x+1<12,135+x<4)[<,x]$

display mode

boxed equation

greek letters


If you know $display(\LaTeX)$ you can input it directly by wrapping $display(\LaTeX)$ syntax inside the display() function. This will be plugged into $display(\KaTeX)$ so any of their <a href="https://katex.org/docs/supported.html">supported functions</a> should work. Despite the name, using single dollar signs will use inline mode while double dollar signs are required for display mode.

The expression will not be parsed and thus cannot include external variables or be saved as a variable.

$display(\frac{3^{12}}{4})$

If you just want to generate the $display(\LaTeX)$ syntax you can use the latex() function. Any valid mathematical expression will be latexified. Variables can be included and arithmetic can be performed inside. If you include a name after the dollar signs then the parsed expression will be saved not the latex output.

$4^11$[A]

$latex(3^12/7+A+=(3+4)[A])$
