Comprehensive Test Suite
========================

The following examples showcase almost every feature of Inline Math. The markdown on the left shows the exact syntax used and can be edited to see what happens. Anything not inside of dollar signs or a code block will be parsed as markdown using markedjs. For more details, each header can be clicked on to go to a dedicated page with more examples.

Mathematical Expressions
------------------------

Math can be included by wrapping an expression inside a pair of dollar signs like $x^12$. Expressions will be converted into postfix notation and then LaTeX that is passed to katex. Most basic mathematical expressions should work including exponents: $x^12$, fractions: $1/2$, trig: $sin(0)$, constants like $pi$ and $e$.

**Calculus**

$ddx(x)$

$dd?(t^3;t)$

$idx(x^2)$

$id?(t^3;t)$



Variable Expressions
--------------------

By appending [A] after dollar signs, the interior expression will be stored as a variable. The variable must be exactly one uppercase letter. These variables can be called later inside any expression. 

$7^2$[A]

$A+1$[B]

$x=B$

Inputs
------

User input can be asked for by including the appropriate function within dollar signs and appending the desired variable as normal.

checkbox(Yes,No) produces a checkbox with the first argument representing the value of the expression when checked and the second argument is the value of the expression when unchecked. If no arguments are used, the default is 1 and 0 for yes and no, respectively.
$checkbox(x^2,0)$[C]

$C$

radio(0,1,2,3) produces a series of radio buttons. The arguments are the values of each radio button.
$radio(1+3^2,2,3^2)$[D]

$D$

number(min,max) produces a input box that accepts numbers. The arguments are optional minimum and maximum values.
$number(10,70)$[E]

$E$

range(min,max) produces a range slider with the arguments representing minimum and maximum values.
$range(10,70)$[F]

$F$

input() produces a text box that accepts any text.
$input()$[G]

$G$


Code
----

For now only javascript code is supported, but adding more languages is on the roadmap. To create a code block, add a line with 3 tick marks (i.e. \`\`\`). Then add lines of code and finally close with another line of 3 tick marks.

Any mathematical expression within the code will be converted into a latex expression. Other parts of code will be highlighted by prismjs.

Variables (as uppercase letters) can be imported from outside.

It is possible to copy the underlying code by selecting the relevant lines and then clicking the "copy code" button. Or you can copy the latex by clicking the "copy latex" button. 

```
var x = math.cos(2);
var x = Math.sin(2);
var z = A+4;
```

Calculator
----------

Arithmetic can be performed to simplify expressions. Or the symbolic solver can be used to evaluate calculus expressions.
