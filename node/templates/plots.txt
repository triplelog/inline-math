Any single variable function wrapped in plot() will return a simple plot.
$$plot(x^2)$$



Trig functions (in radians), square roots, logarithms, and basic arithmetic operations of +,-,*,/, and ^ should work. Division by zero or other non numerical outputs should be skipped.

$$plot(y=cos(x))$$

Square roots.
$$plot(y=sqrt(x))$$

Variables can be called from inside.
$range(0,10)$[A]
$$plot(y=x+A)$

The domain and range can be changed by adding arguments in plot(function,left,right,bottom,top) order.
$$plot(y=x^2,-5,5,-3,30)$$

Domain and range sliders can be added by adding [DR] after plot(). Or use plot()[D] to just add a domain slider.
$$plot(y=x^2)[DR]$$

Functions are assumed to have $x$ as the independent variable and $y$ as the dependent variable. To change the dependent variable, start with something like $y=$. Although at the moment the name of the dependent variable is largely irrelevant. To change the independent variable, start with something like $y(t)=$.

If the dependent variable is $x$ then the horizontal axis will remain the x-axis and the independent variable will take the vertical axis. To use the vertical axis for the independent variable in other cases requires adding the capital letter F inside [] between the end of plot() and the closing dollar sign.

Using the double dollar signs will produce a div that is 15 rem tall and 15 rem wide. Using single dollar signs will produce a span that is 1.5 rem tall and 1.5 rem wide. If you need an inline plot like $plot(x^2-6)$, the small plots can look okay but there is very little room for complex data.


Coming Soonish
--------------

More control over formatting, sizing, coloring, labeling, etc.

Polar coordinates
